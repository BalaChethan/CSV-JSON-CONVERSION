# CSV-JSON-CONVERSION
Data Engineering Pipeline for CSV to JSON Conversion	
•	Developed a robust data engineering pipeline using Python and Pandas to seamlessly convert CSV files retrieved from a PostgreSQL database into JSON files, significantly enhancing downstream application efficiency.
•	Demonstrated strong proficiency in data manipulation techniques by employing Python and Pandas to seamlessly transform CSV files into DataFrame structures, and subsequently converting them to JSON format.
•	Validated the accuracy of the data transformation process through meticulous schema checks between the resulting JSON files and the source CSV files, utilizing schema.json for reference.
•	Ensured data completeness and consistency by conducting comprehensive record count comparisons between the source CSV files and the target JSON files.
•	Contributed to the optimization of downstream applications by delivering high-quality JSON files that facilitated efficient data processing and analysis.
•	Developed expertise in data conversion strategies, file management practices, and robust data validation procedures throughout the project.
•	Tools Utilized: Python, Pandas, PostgreSQL, JSON, schemas.json validation.
